# Chess in C++
## Implementation of Chess, playable in Terminal

This is an implementation of Chess in C++. The board provides a list of all possible valid moves, and flips every time someone makes a move. The board prevents a player from making an illegal move. The board also allows you to undo your previous move, by typing 'u'. Play a move by typing the initial square and the final square, e.g. a3a4

Enjoy!
